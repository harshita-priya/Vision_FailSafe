# Vision Fail-Safe Algorithm Development – RoboRide

## Overview
Autonomous driving technology has the potential to revolutionize transportation, but it faces challenges related to vision impairments. This project focuses on developing a **Vision Fail-Safe (VFS) system** to enhance the robustness of self-driving cars by addressing vision-related issues such as **low illumination, sun glare, rain, fog, dust, and blur**.

## Problem Statement
One of the major causes of autonomous vehicle failures is **impaired vision due to environmental factors**. Rain, fog, dust, and low illumination can significantly degrade sensor and camera performance, leading to incorrect object detection and increased accident risks. The **Vision Fail-Safe (VFS) system** aims to ensure that autonomous driving remains safe and efficient under challenging visual conditions.

1. **Data Acquisition Module** - Collects real-world image and video data from onboard cameras.
2. **Preprocessing Module** - Applies noise reduction, image enhancement, and augmentation techniques.
3. **Deep Learning Model** - Uses a hybrid architecture combining **U-Net, HarDNet, and convolutional layers** to enhance vision under difficult conditions.
4. **Inference & Decision System** - Deploys trained models to process real-time camera input and predict corrective actions.
5. **Automated Cleaning System** - Controls water usage and sensor cleaning mechanisms to optimize visibility.

    image = resize(image, (256, 256))
    image = normalize(image)
    return image

# Inference Pipeline
def vision_failsafe_pipeline(image):
    processed_image = preprocess_image(image)
    prediction = model(processed_image)
    return enhance_image(prediction)

# Postprocessing & Decision Making
def enhance_image(prediction):
    enhanced_image = apply_filters(prediction)
    return enhanced_image
```
